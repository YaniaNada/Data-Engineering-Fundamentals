This repository is to follow the lab activities from the [6-week free Data Engineering YouTube boot camp](https://youtu.be/myhe0LXpCeo). 

My objective with this bootcamp is to experience and understand better what Data Engineers do.

All the set up instructions can be found here: [DataExpert-io/data-engineer-handbook](https://github.com/DataExpert-io/data-engineer-handbook/tree/main/bootcamp/materials/1-dimensional-data-modeling). I'm using the Docker option instead of local machine setup to run Postgres and PGAdmin.
